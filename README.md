# Memory-game

## Mission

Recreate the famous 'memory' game.

## Objectives

- Change things in the DOM
- React to keypresses

## The Game

There are 12 cards in this deck (6 pairs). When you click a card it flips around and shows the back image. Try to match the pairs by clicking the other cards. When you flipped every card, you won the game. The game counts your moves and there is a timer to get on your nerves. Act fast!
